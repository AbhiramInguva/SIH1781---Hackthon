# Education Recommendation System

## Overview
The Education Recommendation System is an innovative tool designed to assist university students in making informed decisions about their academic and career paths. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, this system provides personalized recommendations for studies and potential career directions based on a student's academic performance, extracurricular activities, and personal interests.

## Features
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Utilizes a machine learning model to suggest top 3 career paths or study areas.
- **Comprehensive Input**: Considers various factors including academic scores, extracurricular activities, gender, part-time job status, and study habits.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use web interface for inputting student data and viewing recommendations.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Engaging home page with changing background images.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), JavaScript
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Data Processing**: NumPy
- **Model Persistence**: Pickle

## How It Works
1. Students input their personal and academic information through a web form.
2. The system processes this information using a pre-trained machine learning model.
3. Based on the model's predictions, the system recommends the top 3 most suitable career paths or study areas.
